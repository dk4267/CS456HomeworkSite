<p>Find 2 examples of good user interface design, and 2 examples of bad user interface design.
Your examples should be specific. It's very hard to find a large interface that's completely good or completely bad, so don't try. Instead, focus on a particular feature or aspect of a user interface that makes your case. Find concrete reasons for your judgment.
You aren't limited to desktop software. Web sites offer many great candidates for fame and shame. You aren't even limited to traditional computer interfaces. Feel free to go out into the real world, and consider consumer appliances, car dashboards, building entrances, traffic intersections, shower controls, etc. (Norman's book Design of Everyday Things includes a lot of examples of this kind, which you may find inspirational.)
</p>

<p>Your report should include 2 good examples and 2 bad examples. For each example:</p>

<ul><li>Describe the purpose of the overall interface</li>
<li>Describe the particular aspect you find good or bad</li>
<li>Explain why it's good or bad if bad, speculate why it might have been designed that way, and suggest a better design if possible</li>
<li>Illustrate with screenshots or photographs if possible</li></ul>
